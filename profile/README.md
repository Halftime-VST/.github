## Halftime VST For PC & Windows


HalfTime by Cableguys is a VST audio effect plugin that instantly creates dark, downtempo versions of audio by slowing it down. It works by slowing down the tempo (2x, 4x, or 1.5x) and can be used on individual tracks, groups, or even live inputs to add mood, texture, and unique rhythmic possibilities to music like trap, EDM, and hip-hop. Key features include frequency band splitting, a wet/dry mix with fade controls, and adjustable loop lengths to shape the effect.
